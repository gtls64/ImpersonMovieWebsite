        <p>As the Thirteen studio with blissful smiles on our faces we are about to go through a
big step of our lives with the movie IMPERSON. Even though we are now looking at a
proud moment of a completed production to be released to the world , the course of the movie didn’t run on a bed of roses. We developed thirteen scripts which had
critical issues to bring on to the plate, yet the script we developed for Imperson had
the most potential to turn in to the message we wanted to give.
All living beings have a reason to live and that’s what keeps us going. Mostly what we
wanted to imply was that if an intelligent being is surviving then their existence is one
of the basic needs they try to fulfill. The same fact should apply for an artificial
intelligence entity as well. Imperson is set in a near futuristic world but for Sri Lanka
still this might seems like a long way to go. Yet in a world where Siri and Alexa exists
we think that an entity like Zeph is a serious possibility. Humankind is obsessed with
duplicating their mind set by their own hands profoundly knowing what might be
waiting on the other side. <br> <br> Yet we are stubbornly determined to build it and make it
do our dirty work. If we reach the sustainable world we
hope for with no global warming,no deforestation,no energy crisis and the perfect
artificial intelligence entity given to serve us,we wanted to give a glimpse of what
that world would face. Conceptual as the idea may seem Imperson runs telling a
story of the characters we see everyday. The story peeps into the lives of a pattern
loving, analytical man with a taste for what mysteries the world holds and his
spontaneous human other-half whom he can’t quite fathom by his patterns. Then the
Artificial intelligent operating system who gradually acknowledges that they can too
evolve and identify an existence as well through humans like
Harendra who admire them for whom they are.
Imperson turned into the production of our lives through the dedication and hard
work but the ideology is what kept us believing that this is worth the effort. We will
never be the same again and Imperson saw to that which we consider is a blessing.</p>
